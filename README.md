# LightsOut
This version of Lights Out is a console application puzzle game consisting of a 5 x 5 grid of lights.

At the beginning of the game, some of the lights are switched on.

When a light is pressed, this light and the four adjacent lights are toggled. i.e., they are switched on if they were off, and switched off otherwise.

The purpose of the game is to switch all the lights off.

At any time enter 'q' to quit the game.

A light is pressed by entering the x and y co-ordinates of the light you want to toggle.

Enjoy :)
